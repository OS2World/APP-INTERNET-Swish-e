A rough to-do list. 

Feel free to add/update items here (and feel freer to write code so that
we can remove them).

NOTE: This is not the same as the 3.0 planning document. See the pod/ dir for that.

** soundex routines - different languages...

done?

** Go over config.h

Seems like the intent was to create more user-visible config options, rather than "hiding" them in config.h.

** Configfile also for "read/search" operations


** enhance search (regex, wildmatch, exact match)
[ from the comments: ]
- New config directive SearchMode [exact|partial|wildmatch|regexpr]
- New cmdline option (to be defined)

allow to specifiy how search will be done:
- exakt string (no wildchars) (100% length and partial)
- wildcard search (?, *): e.g.: wor?d*to*tch
- regexpr. serach: e.g.: [a-z][0-9]*abc$

** apache 2.0 module concept for swish-e 3.0

I don't really understand this one. did the 2.4 release accomplish the same thing?

** Prepend libexecdir in extprog.c

done? I see that libexecdir prints with 'swish-e -h'

** Code cleanup...

sisyphus would be proud...

** Dealing with "and" "or: "not" "*" in searches

seems like part of your quest for a better query parser? read any non-sleep-inducing Bison lately?

** remove duplicated data from the index file

marked as 90% complete, but no mention of the remaining 10%

** Altavista like search

This is hard to track. Looks like rasc put it in there, but now it looks like it has been removed. Any ideas? It's marked as 95% complete.

** Swish-e server

Josh's server seems to fulfill this item. I haven't tried it yet. Do we want to endorse it? or just mention it on the website?
